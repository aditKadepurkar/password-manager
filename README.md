# High Level
I have no clue right now how I am going to do this!
The idea is essentially that all the passwords are stored locally on the users machine so they don't have to worry about password leaks from password managers side. The issue with a python script running like that is that web browsers might not like the script jumping in and watching what is happening. Maybe this could be better done as an extension?
Anyways I would also like this password manager to automatically go in an update certain passwords, periodically--all depending on user settings.
This is also like pretty low priority on my TODO list for now so progress will probably be slow, but I do hope to make something useful here.
